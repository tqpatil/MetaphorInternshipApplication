## Git+Metaphor: A tool for finding useful tools
Github contains a treasure trove of hidden or often unused useful tools that people rarely stumble upon, as people rely solely on programs that are not open-source or are very popular.

This tool uses Langchain to create an LLM who's primary purpose is to prescribe github repositories to people depending on the problem they are trying to solve or the question that ask. 

You must include txt files in the same directory as the notebook containing your OPENAI API key, your OPENAI Organization key, and your Metaphor API key. 

Also make sure you have the necessary pip installs including: 

* pip install pydantic
* pip install langchain
* pip install metaphor-python
